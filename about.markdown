Hey, I'm Antonio Cascais.

This is my space for documenting personal projects, side quests, and little experiments — mostly around code, AI, infrastructure, and open-source tools. Think of it as a digital lab notebook.

Most posts here are quick notes about things I’ve built, broken, or explored. Nothing polished. No tutorials. Just raw output from the terminal and the occasional AI-assisted hack.

### What I Work With
- Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana  
- Arch Linux (btw)  
- Privacy-first infra  
- Treating AI tools like CLI utilities — running experiments with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini to see what sticks

### Projects

Some of the tools and experiments I’ve built:

- **[VoxLogAI](https://voxlogai.acascais.com)**  
  AI-powered transcription and OCR platform using Gemini. Converts audio, YouTube videos, PDFs, and images into clean text with minimal effort.

- **[AItley](https://t.me/aitley_bot)**  
  A Telegram bot that analyzes workout form from video clips and provides AI-powered feedback + fitness coaching. Built for curious lifters who like data.

These projects are living experiments — always evolving as I explore better ways to integrate AI into everyday tools.

If you're into lightweight automation, DevOps tinkering, and open-source everything, you might find something useful here.

Thanks for dropping by.
